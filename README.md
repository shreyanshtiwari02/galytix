creating a .net app for post requests

did the setup of the dotnet app in my vscode

created a controller for receiving post requests at the url route "http://localhost:9091/api/server/postexample"

the json object sent was
{
     "country": "ae",
     "lob": ["property", "transport"]
 }
i was able to successfully receive the data with a return status code of 200 i.e ok
i couldnt solve the rest due to time constraints
here are the ss of the postman
